# Key-Value Store

This project implements a reliable and efficient key-value store. It provides a simple API for storing and retrieving data using key-value pairs.

## Features

- **Fast and Efficient:** Optimized data storage and retrieval for quick access to key-value pairs.
- **Scalable:** Easily adjusts to your data storage needs by adding or removing nodes (depending on implementation).
- **Persistent (Optional):** Optionally persist data to disk for data protection beyond server restarts.
- **Distributed (Optional):** Replicate data across multiple nodes for high availability and fault tolerance (consider using a distributed consensus protocol like Raft or Paxos in this case).

**Note:** The specific features, such as persistence and distributed functionality, may depend on your chosen implementation details.

## Installation

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js (version 18 or later) with npm package manager

**Project Setup:**

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sidd1211/key-value-store.git
Use code with caution.

Navigate to the project directory:
Bash
cd key-value-store
Use code with caution.

Install dependencies:
Bash
npm install
Use code with caution.

Usage
Without Persistence:

Start the application:
Bash
node index.js
Use code with caution.

Interact with the key-value store through your preferred HTTP client or language library.
With Persistence (Optional):

Additional Configuration: Refer to implementation-specific documentation for configuring data persistence (e.g., setting a storage location).
Starting the Application: Follow the same steps as outlined above.
API Endpoints
POST /api/

Creates a new key-value pair.
Request body: { key: string, value: string }
Response: { message: string } (message indicates success or error)
GET /api/:key

Retrieves the value associated with the specified key.
Response: { value: string } (or error message if key not found)
DELETE /api/:key

Deletes the key-value pair associated with the specified key.
Response: { message: string } (message indicates success or error)
Testing
Run the tests:
Bash
npm test
Use code with caution.
